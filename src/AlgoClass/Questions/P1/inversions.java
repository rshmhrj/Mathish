/*     This is a program to count the number of inversions in a
 *  permutation of integers.  Actually this will process several
 *  arrays.  
 *
 *  The input should be in the following format:
 *    L
 *    n_1 n_2 .....  n_L
 *    L
 *    n_1 n_2 .....  n_L
 *    ....
 *    ....
 *    0
 *
 *  Each list consists of L integers (L can vary from list to list).
 *  The elements of each list are contained in a single line.    
 *
 *  After the final list, the input is terminated with a 0 (i.e. L=0)
 *  to indicate the end of the input.
 *
 *  Note:  I'm assuming that the integers in each list are distinct (but
 *  they need not necessarily be the consecutive integers 1, 2, ..., n).
 *       Results might be unpredictable (depending upon how you implement 
 *  your methods) if there are duplicated items in a list.
 *
 *  It's easiest if you redirect input from a file (ask me if you
 *  don't know how to do this).  For example you can try this command:
 *     % java Inversions <input
 *
 *  RAM   20 February 2009
 *
 *
 *        ***Running time***
 * Since this algorithm is basically a modified MergeSort (see
 *  my remarks in the "countInversions" procedure below), this algorithm
 *  runs in time O(n log n) for a list of length n.

             We use a modified version of the MergeSort algorithm to 
             do this, so it's a recursive function.  We split the

             inversions caused by one element from each part of 
             the list.
